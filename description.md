## Description
The Nokia N73 is a smartphone announced by Nokia on 25 April 2006, as part of the Nseries[1] and started shipping on 24 July. The N73 succeeded the N70 and packed in numerous multimedia features. It features a 3.2 megapixel autofocus camera, a front camera, a then-large 2.4 inch display, and stereo speakers,[2] all in a relatively slim and pocketable size and form.[3] It runs on Symbian v9.1 (S60 3rd Edition).
