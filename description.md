## Description
The Nokia N73 is a smartphone announced by Nokia on 25 April 2006, as part of the Nseries[1] and started shipping on 24 July. The N73 succeeded the N70 and packed in numerous multimedia features. It features a 3.2 megapixel autofocus camera, a front camera, a then-large 2.4 inch display, and stereo speakers,[2] all in a relatively slim and pocketable size and form.[3] It runs on Symbian v9.1 (S60 3rd Edition).
It became one of the top selling Nseries devices during 2006 and 2007, and its high popularity helped Nokia's sales of 'multimedia' phones grow 28% year-on-year in Q3 2007 (according to Nokia the other top selling from the line were the N70 and N95).
